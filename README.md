# matplotlib

A brief description of your project goes here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x: Download and install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/).
- pip: pip is the package installer for Python. If you have Python 3.x installed, pip should be included with it by default. You can verify if pip is installed by running `pip --version` in your terminal.

### Setting up a virtual environment

A virtual environment is an isolated Python environment in which you can install and manage project-specific dependencies. To set up a virtual environment for your project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project in the terminal.

2. Create a virtual environment named `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv venv

```
